# gdx-particle-system

## Description

`gdx-particle-system` is a work in progress particles library for [libgdx](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx).

It's a minimalist version (without box2d and lights) of [box2d-light-particle](https://github.com/alyrow/box2d-light-particle)
which will be re-done with this core lib.

I am not actively working on it but feel free to contribute!

I want to give a special thanks to [@Minecraftian14](https://github.com/Minecraftian14/) which has done so much work for this lib! :tada:

## Functionality

- Jsonify particle system
- Set particles type
- Set "live" zone of particles

### Rules

Set particle system rules

- Emission duration
- Emission number
- Particle life

### Modifiers

Apply modifiers when a particle is created

- Gradient Colors
- Random charge
- Random colors
- Random mass
- Random spawn position rectangle

### Physics

Forces applied to particles

- Black hole
- Black line
- Brownian force
- Color point
- Drain
- Fan
- Image colour
- Linear force
- Path follow
- Point attract
- Point electrostatic force
- Radial force
- Random linear force
- Random radial force
- Revolution
- Whirlpool
- White hole
- White line

Many things are missing, but I hope a day it will be done :laughing:
